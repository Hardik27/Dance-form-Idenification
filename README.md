# Dance-form-Idenification

Trained 364 images in the train set using 4 Pre-trained models viz: VGG16, VGG19, ResNet50 and InceptionV3. Using this Transfer-learning approach achieved an accuracy of 78.37% on the test set. To further increase the accuracy, implemented data augmentation technique to generate artificial images in the batches of 32. 

## Result

Data Augmentation along with Hyperparameter tuning finally led to an accuracy of 83.89% which placed me in top 2% in the pool of 5864 participants
